  Tagging is a form of metadata that is used to catalouge infomormation based on specific terms chosen by a user. Tags are designed to link documents that are somehow related. A user choses a specific term and tags the page with that term, linking the page to other documents or pages with the same tag. Tags are designed for convenience, they allow users to easily find similar pages catalouged on the same database. 
  
  The taged keywords that are seen are more than just surface level symbols that represent all the pages and documents connected through that particular keyword. Like all languages, each individual tagd keyword is a symbol for a larger concept. Tags are nothing more than an expansion on the langauge they are written in, but they have the ability to be so much more. 
  
  Up until this point users of tags have merely imported the plain meaning of words for use as tags but an individual word contains so much more information than its plain meaning. There is a countless amount information that is not being tapped. Words have multiple meaning and hold much more information than their common usage.  

 Locked into each industry is databases of knowledge. Members of indusry tap into these databases to do their jobs. Everything that is read or written has a meaning specific to an indusry. 

  There is a divide between people who speak different languages. Communication barries segregate not just the internet, but the entire world. While tools such as google translate make it possible to partially overcome these bariers large amounts of information is still lost because of an inability to understand. Translation tools allow information to be partially understood when discovered but the real problem is making the information discoverable to all people not just those who speak the right langauge. 
  
  In order to overcome this languge hurdle there needs to be a catalogue system that ignores the language divide. A universal system that represents information through a series of symbols which remain constant irrespective of the langauge of a user. What is needed is a tag system that will allow for information to be linked based on concept regardless of the langauge it is written.
  
  Not all languages be broken down. Some langugaes aren't based on geographic location but rather learned knowleged. Every profession has its own langauge. Concepts that are only known to those inside. These concepts are represented by a shorthadn that takes years to master the meaning. 
  
  
  
  First step toward universal language?
