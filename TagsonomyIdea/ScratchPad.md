# Rough Draft

  There is a divide between people who speak different languages. Communication barries segregate not just the internet, but the entire world. While tools such as google translate make it possible to partially overcome these bariers large amounts of information is still lost because of an inability to understand. Translation tools allow information to be partially understood when discovered but the real problem is making the information discoverable to all people not just those who speak the right langauge. 
  
  In order to overcome this languge hurdle there needs to be a catalogue system that ignores the language divide. A universal system that represents information through a series of symbols which remain constant irrespective of the langauge of a user. What is needed is a tag system that will allow for information to be linked based on concept regardless of the langauge it is written.
  
  Not all languages be broken down. Some langugaes aren't based on geographic location but rather learned knowleged. Every profession has its own langauge. Concepts that are only known to those inside. These concepts are represented by a shorthadn that takes years to master the meaning. 
  
  Locked into each industry is databases of knowledge. Members of indusry tap into these databases to do their jobs. Everything that is read or written has a meaning specific to an indusry.
  
  First step toward universal language?
